    This project was done in a 'Creative Product Design' class. My team was tasked with creating a new product that contributes to societal development. We designed and built a <span style="color:#2a5db8">__autonomous driving robot platform with tri-shelf rotating mechanism that follows specific worksman, provide task-specific tools and automatically refill empty shelf__</span> to reduce labor and enlarge productivity at large manufacturing plants. 
    <br>
    I was responsible for <span style="color:#2a5db8">constructing the actuation parts, circuit design of the whole system under restricted battery constraints.</span> In addition I developed the whole algorithm for BLDC motor control without encoder soley by hall sensor feedback and precise PWM control with hand-made RC filter.
    Marking this achievement, we are preparing a patent and a publication for this product.

### SAJOGI, a Spot Micro
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
    Built a Spot Micro robot from scratch based on [open-source model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3761340)

    My SPOT, **SAJOGI** is made with high-torque servo motors and has *RaspberryPi4B* for controller. 12 motors are controlled by a PCA9685 driver with modified capacitor of 1200Î¼F. He can walk forward and crouch! LiDAR implementation and SLAM experiment is ongoing. However he does have some structural defects due to unexpected motor size so I will need some time and money to make him function perfectly.
