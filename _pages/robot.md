<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
This project was done in a 'Creative Product Design' class. My team was tasked with creating a new product that contributes to societal development. We designed and built a <span style="color:#4993FE">__autonomous driving robot platform with tri-shelf rotating mechanism that follows specific worksman, provide task-specific tools and automatically refill empty shelf__</span> to reduce labor and enlarge productivity at large manufacturing plants. 
<br>
I was responsible for constructing the actuation parts, circuit design of the whole system under restricted battery constraints. In addition I developed the whole algorithm for BLDC motor control without encoder soley by hall sensor feedback and precise PWM control with hand-made RC filter.
Marking this achievement, we are preparing a patent and a publication for this product.
