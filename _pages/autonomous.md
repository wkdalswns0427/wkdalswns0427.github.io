<span style="font-size:0.8em;">
    I participated in Yonsei Univ. for the competition as a member of localization team.<br>
    <span style="color:#4993FE">Localization(my role) </span>: developed pre-localization package that fuses orientation and position data from two different IMUs and a GPS sensor.
