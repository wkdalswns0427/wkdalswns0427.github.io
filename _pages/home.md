Hello! My name is Minjun Chang. I am an undergraduate senior in Mechanical Engineering at Yonsei University. I am currently working as a research intern at [Dynamic Robotic Systems Lab](http://dyros.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University.

<br><span style="font-size:0.8em;">
My research interest is built around using control theory for robots and autonomous driving systems as well as integrating different systems for single controller. Especially, I am interested in building safe and reliable automation in robotic applications in hazardous conditions. I am interested in planning and navigation of legged robots and autonomous vehicles. Also, I want to conduct a study using reinforcement learning and control theory to create natural movemement of robots in real world.
