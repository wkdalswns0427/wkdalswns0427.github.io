    I worked on reinforcement learning based bipedal robot locomotion with Bolt10 model. Main task is to configure profound policy that applies well on real world robot.
    <br>Simulation and learning is conducted on IsaacGym(NVIDIA) framework with cuda12.2. using RL framework rl_games

    Although I succeeded simulation of th e robot locomotion in legged_gym and rsl_rl environment, progress on implementing the task to rl_games was lagging. So I switched to Bolt6 model and am working on Sim2Real implementation at this moment.
