    I am currently working on reinforcement learning based bipedal robot locomotion with Bolt10 model. Main task is to configure profound policy that applies well on real world robot.(Starting 8th July officially, I have begun the project little earlier to minimize time loss in setup and get the feel of it.)
    <br>Simulation and learning is conducted on IsaacGym(NVIDIA) framework with cuda12.2.
